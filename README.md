## Introduction
This work present a crystal structure generation framework based on the Stable Diffusion architecture (SD-MOFNet) designed to enable intelligent, high-throughput interpretation of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns and subsequent reconstruction of atomic-level crystal structures for metalâ€“organic frameworks (MOFs). SD-MOFNet leverages pretrained models to extract salient features from PXRD spectra alongside essential prior information, facilitating the generation of structural building-block sites within the unit cell. Using experimental MOF structures from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) as the training dataset, and experimentally obtained PXRD patterns as test cases, we demonstrate that SD-MOFNet effectively captures spectral features, integrates physicochemical information from metal nodes and organic linkers, and subsequently generates the critical structural sites necessary for assembling complete atomic structures. By employing a coarse-grained(CG) strategy, SD-MOFNet effectively overcomes the limitations traditionally imposed by atom count in crystal structure prediction (CSP) tasks, thus enabling its broad applicability across diverse MOF domains. The proposed framework offers a novel technological route toward automated structural determination in high-throughput MOF experiments, significantly advancing the application of machine learning methods within analytical and structural chemistry.
